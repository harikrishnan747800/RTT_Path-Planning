Prepared By Harikrishnan U
-------------------------------------------------------------

ASSUMPTIONS
1. Obstacles are rectangluar
2. The number of Obstacles can be changed 
3. Valid nodes are presented by Red.
4. Start and Goal Coordinates are currently set to type Integer
5. Coordinates to be entered in a line seperated by space of the format(X,Y)
6. The size of obstacles are considered to be same


INSTRUCTIONS
1. The folder contains 3 files-RRTmain.py, RRTbg.py, README.txt.

2. Run "RRTmain.py"

3. Enter the cordinates seperated by a space as prompted.
	First-Enter the dispplay or Map size
	Second-Enter the Starting Coordinates in (X Y) format
	Third-Enter the Goal Coordinates in (X Y) format

4. The code needs following Python libraries to run successfully:
	a. Random
	b. math
	c. pygame

5. The output is displayed in a seperate Window called "Output"

6. The code might demand a shell reboot sometimes for repeated iterations.
